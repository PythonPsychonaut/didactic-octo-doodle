/*
Evaluating Postfix Expressions
Write a program that reads postfix expressions and prints their values. Each input
expression should be entered on its own line, and the program should terminate when
the user enters a blank line.
Assume only binary operators, and that the expressions contain no variables. Note that
you will need to use parentheses to indicate the order of application of the operators in
the expression. Here are sample inputâ€“output pairs:
78                      78
78 6 +                  84
78 6 + 9 2 - /          12
