/*
Balanced Parentheses
A string of characters has balanced parentheses if each right parentheses occurring in the
string is matched with a preceding left parentheses in the same way each right brace in a
C++ program is matched with a preceding left brace. Write a program that uses a stack to
determine whether a string entered at the keyboard has balanced parentheses.
