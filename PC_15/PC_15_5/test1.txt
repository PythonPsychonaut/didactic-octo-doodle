TESTING FOR THE END OF A FILE IS ACCOMPLISHED BY CALLING THE EOF MEMBER FUNCTION, AS YOULEARNED IN CHAPTER 5. THE EOF FUNCTION, HOWEVER, IS NOT THE BEST WAY TO DETERMINE WHETHERTHERE IS STILL DATA LEFT IN THE FILE WHEN READING FROM THE FILE USING THE EXTRACTION OPERATOR.DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE FILE CONTAINS WHITESPACE AFTER THE LAST ITEM, CODE USING EOF TOCHECK FOR THE END OF A FILE WILL EITHER MISS THE LAST DATA ITEM IN THE FILE OR READ THE LAST DATAITEM TWICE. A BETTER WAY TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS DATA LEFT IN THE FILE IS TO ATTEMPT A READ, ANDTHEN CALL THE FAIL FUNCTION TO FIND OUT IF THE READ WAS SUCCESSFUL. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FOLLOWINGCODE FRAGMENT WILL READ AND PRINT TO THE SCREEN ALL NUMBERS STORED IN A FILE:THERE IS ANOTHER WAY OF TESTING WHETHER A READ OPERATION WAS SUCCESSFUL. THIS METHOD ISBASED ON THE FACT THAT THE EXTRACTION OPERATOR >> RETURNS A VALUE THAT CAN BE TESTED TO DETERMINETHE SUCCESS OF THE OPERATION. THUS THE ATTEMPT TO READ AND THE SUBSEQUENT TEST FOR SUCCESSCAN BE DONE BY PUTTING THE READ OPERATION AS THE TEST FOR LOOP CONTINUATION IN A WHILELOOP AS FOLLOWS:NOTICE THAT THE INITIAL READ OUTSIDE THE LOOP AND THE SECOND READ AT THE END OF THE LOOP AREBOTH ELIMINATED BECAUSE THEY ARE FOLDED INTO THE LOOP TEST.THE EOF FUNCTION CAN RELIABLY BE USED TO TEST FOR END OF DATA IN BINARY FILES BECAUSE THEREARE NO WHITESPACE SEPARATORS IN THAT KIND OF FILE. BINARY FILES ARE COVERED IN A LATER SECTION.ARE NO WHITESPACE SEPARATORS IN THAT KIND OF FILE. BINARY FILES ARE COVERED IN A LATER SECTION..
